Helicopter Emergency Transport in Upstate New York
======
[PDF](/files/Helicopter.pdf)

•	Led a five-student team to model and implement a New York State helicopter rescue system

•	Analyzed historical data, and performed thinning method simulation to generate random data

•	Developed an algorithm using a heuristic method to compute the optimal location arrangement for 5 to 12 helicopters. Optimized the average response time to 0.42 hours, and the available rate at 79.5%


Domestics Flight Delay Analysis
======
[PDF](/files/delay.pdf)

•	Built models in Python to investigate a dataset of 5,000,000 flights delays and cancellations in the U.S

•	Predicted future airplane delays with A/B testing, exponential smoothing, seasonality, and other machine learning techniques, successfully predicted the delay time in next year with 90% accuracy in 3 minutes

•	Published advice for passengers regarding choosing flight through intuitive visualization by SQL and Tableau, and demonstrated the correlation between airplane delays and factors such as weather, time, etc



COVID-19 Prediction from Symptoms
======
[PDF](/files/covid.pdf)

•	Performed statistical analysis model to forecast the probability of positive cases by given symptoms

•	Implemented logistics regression and K-Nearest neighbors and decision trees to achieve accuracy of around 80% and an FNR of around 95% after hyperparameter tuning using K-Fold cross-validation

•	Identified 3 highly important features and make 5 data-driven recommendations to help local government better control Covid cases based on feature importance analysis
