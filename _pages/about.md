A data-driven personal website
======
I'm a first-year master’s student majoring in electrical and computer engineering at Duke University. I received a bachelor of science degree from Cornell University in operations research information engineering. My previous research experience includes transportation engineering, data science in transportation, as well as machine learning. I had an operations research internship experience at Norfolk Southern before. After I finish my master’s degree, I hope to be accepted into a leading PhD program to study aviation or transportation engineering.d
