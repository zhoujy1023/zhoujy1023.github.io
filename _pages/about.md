======
I'm a first-year master’s student in the ECE department at Duke University. I received the bachelor of science degree from Cornell University in operations research information engineering. My previous research experience includes transportation engineering, data science in transportation, as well as operations management. I had an internship experience at Norfolk Southern, as an operations research intern, and at Kingsoft Cloud, as a data scientist intern. After I finishe my the master’s degree, I hopes to be accepted into a leading PhD program to study transportation engineering or aviation mamagement.
