A data-driven personal website

I'm a first-year master’s student in the ECE department at Duke University. I received the bachelor of science degree from Cornell University in operations research information engineering. His previous research experience includes transportation engineering, data science in transportation, as well as operations management. He had an internship experience at Norfolk Southern, as an operations research intern, and at Kingsoft Cloud, as a data scientist intern. After he finishes the master’s degree, he hopes hopes to be accepted into a leading PhD program to study transportation engineering.
