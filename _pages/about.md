Biography
======
I am Jianyang Zhou, currently a second-year master’s student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at <b>Duke University</b>. I got my Bachelor of Science degree in Operations Research Information Engineering from <b>Cornell University</b>.

My research interests include <b>air and railway transportation, airlines operations, data science in transportation, simulation, and machine learning.</b> Before my master's program, I had experience as an operations research intern at [Norfolk Southern](https://www.norfolksouthern.com/), where I gained invaluable industry insights and practical skills that complement my academic training. In the past summer, I joined [MIT JTL-Transit Lab](https://mobility.mit.edu/) as a summer research assistant, developed a delay propagation model for public transportation systems, and simulated optimal time choosing to maximize efficiency. Currently, I am working on my graduation thesis about predict flight delay using machine learning.

I am going to pursue a Ph.D. degree starting in Fall 2025, driven by a desire to delve deeper into research and contribute meaningfully to my field. Please feel free to explore my works and projects. I’m always open to collaboration, discussions, and new ideas! Beyond academia, I am very interested in [exploring the airlines and railway systems worldwide](/gallery). I look forward to further exploration and discovery as I continue to pursue my academic and personal passions.
