light delays pose significant challenges to airline operations, passenger satisfaction, and economic efficiency. Accurately predicting flight delays is crucial for improving air traffic management and mitigating disruptions. Recent advancements in deep learning have enabled more sophisticated models capable of capturing the complex relationships between flight schedules, weather conditions, and airport congestion. In this study, we propose a Hybrid-LSTM (H-LSTM) model that integrates historical flight sequences and real-time flight attributes to predict arrival delay categories. Our model leverages LSTM networks to analyze sequential flight dependencies and a Dense network to incorporate independent flight features, including airport information and meteorological conditions. A sliding window approach was employed to structure historical flight sequences, enhancing the model’s ability to capture delay propagation patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our H-LSTM model achieves and accuracy of 89.4% outperforming baseline random forest methods (85.5%). We also analyzed the performance in different scenarios looking at the traffic of the airports, Among large airports, our model achieved a prediction accuracy of 90.6%, higher than the baseline of 88.4%.
